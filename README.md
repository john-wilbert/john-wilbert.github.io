# Learning Task 1: Personal Website

<h3>How I accomplished each item in the criteria</h3>

- **Application of Concepts Taught**:
With all of the topics that was taught in the guided tasks, I was able to successfully apply the concepts in making my personal website. Additionally, the guided tasks were able to provide simple but a good foundation about HTML tags, CSS selectors and styles, Flexboxes and Grids which helped me in designing and creating my website.

- **Design**:
For the design, I wanted to just keep it minimal, simple, sleek, and pleasing to the eye. Furthermore, with the use of Youtube, I was able to find more inspirations for my overall design. I went with the colors that I believe would match well while being very eye-pleasing.

- **Content**:
For the content, I just wanted to showcase myself, I placed my educational background, skills, interests, and socials. I ensured that all my contents are all valid and accurate.

- **Creativity**:
Creativity wise, I opted to keep the look simple but also give a professional and presentable look. I wanted to keep it refreshing and feel as if the website shows who I am.

With the use of GitHub pages, I was able to deploy my website. This is done so that others are also able see my website with ease.

<h3>Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)</h3>

-  With the exercises that I have done so far, I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe that I was definitely more intrigued about how web development works and for me to be able to make a website was definitely a great experience for me.

<h3>Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)</h3>
- The part that gave me the most struggle is the responsiveness part, figuring out which and how to modify specific parts and trying to align things was kind of annoying and difficult to me. With the help of online resources I was able to somehow understand it, but I still need to improve and learn on this part.

<h3>How you could improve your website in the future?</h3>
- I believe I can add more things and make my website even better, by properly doing and fixing the responsive part is also another factor that I can improve on. Other advanced features of CSS and JavaScript can also be a good addition to my website.
